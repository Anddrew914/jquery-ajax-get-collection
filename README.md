# jQuery AJAX GET

## Prerequisites

-   [http-study](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/http-study)
-   [json-study](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/json-study)

## Objectives

Make HTTP requests using `curl`, the browser address bar, and AJAX for:

-   A resource collection.

Use response data in future requests

## Preparation

Set up the client:

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Create and checkout a new branch (training).
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

We'll make requests of and receive responses from an HTTP server we'll set up
 together:

1.  Open a new terminal (window or tab).
1.  Change into `~/wdi/tmp`.
1.  Fork and clone [library-api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/library-api)
and follow installation instructions listed there.
1.  Once installed, checkout a `jquery-ajax` branch within `library-api`.

We're now ready to make requests.

## Connecting to the library-api

### GET /books

Retrieve a list of books from the API

### Demo: Browser Book Collection

Entering `http://localhost:4741/books` into the chrome address bar.

If not already installed in chrome, let's add a [JSON formatting utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en).

### Demo: Curl Book Collection

`curl` is a command line utility for making http requests.  We'll use curl to
 retrieve the book collection.

### Code Along: Curl Book Collection

Let's write that curl command into a script.

### Code Along: AJAX book Collection

We'll take a stepped approach:

1.  Add a form to `index.html`.
1.  Add a submit input to the form.
1.  Add a submit handler to the form in the document ready event in
 `assets/scripts/index.js`.
1.  Add a collection success and fail handler to `assets/scripts/ui.js`.
1.  Add a book collection retrieval method to `assets/scripts/library-api.js`.
1.  Invoke the collection retrieval method from the submit handler passing the
 success and fail callbacks.
